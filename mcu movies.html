After the devastating ending of Infinity War, the remaining Avengers along with the help of Captain Marvel, Nebula and Rocket seek out Thanos, the Infinity Stones and justice, but they fail as Thanos destroyed the Stones and all hope is lost. 5 years later, however a 
new hope arises and Scott Lang returns from the Quantum Realm with interesting news; they could use the Quantum Realm to travel back in time to get the Stones. At first Tony is reluctant to go ahead with Scots proposed time heist, as now he has a daughter and it takes 
his love and guilt over Peter to convince him. As the Avengers travel back in time however, the past version of Thanos gain knowledge of their plan and comes to an even more terrifying conclusion then before.</p>

After losing Tony and another father figure, Peter feels all alone and pressured to replace him as the new Iron Man. Luckily for him a trip to Europe organized by the school is on the horizon which will help him to find both some peace and love as he is trying to ask 
MJ on a date. However as usual in the life of a superhero that’s not happening. Because soon after the trip starts a group of aliens known as the Elementals show up to ruin Peter’s vacation and destroy the world… but luckily a man known as Quentin Beck also shows up to 
fight them and Peter feels comfortable with him taking over the place of Iron Man. Maybe his wrong…</p>
