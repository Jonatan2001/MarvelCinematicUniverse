Before the MCU Began </span>
</h2>
<p align="left">

<span style="background-color: PEACHPUFF; font-family: Comic Sans MS"> The Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU is a Media Franchise consisting of a series of interconnected movies that all take place in the  
<img src = "images\Xmen.jpg" alt = "Xmen" height = "150" style = "float: right">same movie universe. Therefore the characters can interact with one anotehr andmore often then not the events of a movie will 
effect the events of the next movie. 
<br> 
The MCU may have released it's first movie in 2008, but it has been in the makings since the early 2000's by the man known as Kevin Feige. In '96 Marvel Comics filled for 
bankruptcy and the only way they can save themselves for going out of business is by selling the movie rights of their characters to several different movie studios.
<br>
In 2000 the first X-Men movie was released by 20th Century Fox, on which Feige has worked as an Accociate Producer and he has already went to the executives at Fox back then 
to try to create this universe. Unfortunately no one listened to him. They pratically laughed into his face. They said that this was a terrible idea and that it wasn't executable 
because the rights of these characters were at multiple other studios and it was very unlikely that they were willing to coproduce these movies.
<br> <img src = "images\Kevin.jpg" alt = "Kevin" height = "150" style = "float: right">
This went on until 2006 when at last Feige has decided that rather then trying to have different movie studios to unite to produce these movies, with now the regained movie 
rights of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor they would start their own production company and was able to seccure a loan of $500 million to produce as many movies as possible 
and thus the production on Iron Man began. </span>

Once The MCU Started
</span></h2>
<p> 
<span style="background-color: PEACHPUFF; font-family: Comic Sans MS"> But getting the MCU off the ground once the loans have been accuired wasn't easy either. The biggest problem was the casting of Tony 
Stark or as otherwise known Iron Man. Originally there was talks of casting Tom Cruise in the rolse, but he declined and thats how Jon Favreau the director of the movie 
has decided <img src = "images\RDJ.jpg" alt = "RDJ" height = "150" style = "float: right">to cast Robert Downey Junior as the leading man, eventhough this was a very unpopular decision as RDJ was trying to rebuild his  career after his very public 
drug problems. 
<br> 
But the movie was a great success and a big part of that is that RDJ understood the character that he was playing very well.
<br>
After Iron Man turned out to be both a commercial and critical success, Marvel Studios became more encouraged to 
produce more and more movies and that's exactly what they have done ever since.</span>
