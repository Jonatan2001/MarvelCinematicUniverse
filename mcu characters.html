Tony Stark is self-proclaimed “genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist” who also happens to be an 
egotistical and arrogant man, who is kidnapped, by a group of terrorists, who want him to build them 
a missile, as Tony is a weapon engineer and ironically, he was taken with the very weapons he created. 
Tony agrees to do it, but in secret he and his assistant Yinsen are working on a mechanical suit, that 
will powered by Tony’s chest arc reactor that was fitted in to keep a piece of metal out from his heart. 
Although Tony gets out from the cave where is kept hostage Yinsen isn`t. 
<img src = "images\Iron2.jpg" alt = "Iron2" style = "float: right">
When he returns to America, Tony announces that he will stop manufacturing weapons along with his company. 
In secret he continuous to work on his suit which he uses to fight terrorism and his own weapons. However 
his business partner Obadiah Stane gains knowledge of this and he turns against him and builds his own suit. 
They fight and Tony emerges victorious. Although S.H.I.E.L.D wants to keep Tony’s identity as the man in the 
suit dubbed “Iron Man” a secret he publicly comes out and tells the world “I am Iron Man”.

<img src = "images\Iron3.png" alt = "Iron3" style = "float: right">
6 months later thanks to Tony`s help Earth has become a safer place, however Tony is slowly being killed by 
the very device that is meant to keep him alive. And if that wasn`t enough the government would like to get 
their hands on the Iron Man suit, something which Tony refuses to do. Knowing that he doesn`t has long Tony 
goes out of his way to do as many crazy things as he possible can, for example partying in his Iron Man suit 
on what might very well be his last birthday party.  
<img src = "images\Iron4.png" alt = "Iron4" style = "float: left">
Feeling that he is no longer responsible enough to have the suit, his friend James Rhodes, takes an earlier 
model. The two of them have a fight off, from which Rhodey emerges victorious and he takes the suit. Meanwhile 
simultaneously Ivan Vanko a man who was wronged by Tony`s father seeks revenge against him, by building his 
own Arc Reactor to power his own suits. Tony falls into a depression and Nick Furry has to help him out of it 
by providing him with his long dead and estranged father`s possessions from which Tony learns that his father 
did love and he believed him. Inspired by him, Tony finds a cure to his problem and with new energy he takes

A few months after the incident with the Hulk in New York, Tony visits General “Thunderbolt” Ross and he tells 
him of the Avengers Initiative.
<br>
<br>
A year after that Tony is visited by Phil Colson who tells him of the Tesseract and that Loki has stolen it and 
that S.H.I.E.L.D believes that he wishes to open up a portal in space to unleash his armies. Tony comes on board 
and he meets Captain America, Thor, Hulk and reunites with Black Widow. He and Cap don`t see eye to eye on a lot 
of things and tensions grow so high between them that the only thing that can stop the coming brawl is the fact 
that Loki strikes first. Colson dies in the fight which unites what is left of the team, that being Cap, Black 
Widow, Hawkeye and Tony himself. 
<img src = "images\Iron6.png" alt = "Iron6" style = "float: left">

They return to New York to fight Loki and his army and they are quickly joined by Thor and Banner. Though at first 
it seems that they are losing, after some time they are able to shift the tied, but the world security council doesn`t 
belives that they are doing a good enough job and send a nuke to take out Manahan, Tony is able to take the bomb 
into the other end of the space portal and he goes into deep space himself where he almost dies. But right before 
Black Widow can close the portal he manages to get back to Earth and he gets away with it without any serious harm.
<img src = "images\Iron7.png" alt = "Iron7" style = "float: right">

But his happiness doesn`t last long as after that Tony struggles with PTSD and he tries to create as many Iron Man 
armours as possible to keep himself and Pepper Potts safe. But he fails as the “Mandarin” shows up not long after 
the events of New York, a terrorist, who Tony challenges and effectively putting himself and his loved ones at risk. 
When his house gets destroyed Tony has to get off the grid. After that he is able to return and defeat the Mandarin 
who turned to be Aldrich Killian, someone who he without knowing wronged in the past. Tony seeing the danger that he 
has put his loved ones in decides to destroy all of his suits.
<br>
<br>

However when HYDRA resurfaces Tony returns as Iron Man. He gets a vision of the future and to prevent what he saw taking 
place he creates Ultron, a program that he meant as a global peace keeping program. But Ultron misunderstands his purpose 
and comes to the conclusion that the only way peace can be achieved on Earth is by causing global extinction. Tony is able 
to create a better version of Ultron, known as Vision, who was created thanks to the combination of J.A.R.V.I.S, the Mind 
Stone, and Ultron himself. With the help of Vision the Avengers are able to defeat Ultron, but Tony feeling guilty over the 
amount of lives it took to stop Ultron takes a step back and retires from active duty.
<img src = "images\Iron10.png" alt = "Iron10" style = "float: left">
A year later however, he comes out of retirement to support the Sokovia Accords, to ensure that what happened with Ultron 
would never be repeated again. However Cap disagrees with him and so Tony has no choice but to hunt him and Cap`s team down. <img src = "images\Iron11.jpg" alt = "Iron11" style = "float: right">
He recruits Peter Parker to help them, but after Tony’s team fails and Tony gets evidence of the fact that Bucky Barnes was 
mistakenly blamed for a crime he didn`t commit, he tries to reconcile with Cap. Only to find out that Bucky killed his parents 
and that Cap knew about this. In a fit of rage he starts a fight with them and it takes both Cap and Bucky to defeat him.
<img src = "images\Iron12.png" alt = "Iron12" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
After that he returns to New York to become a mentor to Peter and tries to make him a better hero then he was. At first it seems 
that Peter wouldn’t be up to the task but when he makes up for his mistakes Tony gives him a second chance and he and Pepper Potts 
get engaged. <img src = "images\Iron13.png" alt = "Iron13" style = "float: right">
The following year in 2018, Strange is kidnapped by the Black Order along with the Time Stone. It takes the combined efforts of 
Peter Parker and Tony Stark to save him. After that they go to Thanos` home planet Titan where they meets some of the Guardians 
of the Galaxy and with the leadership of Stark, they device a plan to defeat Thanos. However they can’t stop Thanos and Tony has to 
watch in horror as most of his allies and Peter who has grown to love as a son turn into dust in front of him and die. <img src = "images\Iron14.jpg" alt = "Iron14" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
3 weeks after that Tony is stranded in space along with Nebula and they nearly die, before they are save by Captain Marvel. 
Returning to Earth Tony confronts Cap about his mistakes and that he didn`t believe him about the fact that Tony knew that this 
would happen and that`s why he created Ultron. Five years later, now married and with a daughter Tony learns of an idea of how 
to reverse what happened. At first Tony is reluctant to go ahead with Scots proposed time heist, as now he has a daughter and it 
takes his love and guilt over Peter to convince him. He helps the Avengers build the Time Machine and together with Scott, Cap 
and Banner they travel back to 2012`s New York, but they fail to get the Space Stone, so he and Cap travel back in time to the 
70’s where Tony gets the Tesseract and meets his father, <img src = "images\Iron15.png" alt = "Iron15" style = "float: right">
who doesn`t knows that he is talking to his future son. Tony tells his 
father that he will be just fine at parenting, he knows this as his own father did a good job too. After that he returns to the 
present where Hulk undoes the Snap with the 6 Infinity Stones, however before he could enjoy his victory 2014`s Thanos attacks 
the Avenger`s compound and if it weren`t for the fact that the Avengers are joined by those who were snapped away they wouldn`t 
have won. But eventually they emerge victorious at the cost of Tony’s life.

Wanda and Pietro Maximoff are orphan twins, who lost their parents thanks to Tony Stark’s weapons, though without knowledge and consent. 
After that out of hatred they went under experiments led by HYDRA and with Loki`s Spectre they both gained powers. After the fail of HYDRA, 
the Avengers took out every HYDRA compound one by one until they stumbled upon the one where the twins were kept in Sokovia, the twins put 
off a good fight and Wanda showed Stark his worst fears seeing what he would do Wanda let him take the Spectre.  <img src = "images\Scar2.jpg" alt = "Scar2" style = "float: right">
When Ultron got loose he found the twins and convinced them to join him in an effort to destroy the Avengers and twins and they helped 
Ultron get his hands on enough Vibranium to build a new body which he could transfer his mind into, when this was happening Wanda read his 
mind and realised that Ultron actually wanted to destroy the world, which prompted both of them to switch sides and join the Avengers. In 
the fight against Ultron however Pietro died and Wanda was left alone without family.

and for the next year she helped them take care of all sorts of problems around the world, until on one of their missions Wanda inadvertently 
destroys a building and kills many people, which prompts the United Nations to create the Sokovia Accords which would oversee the Avengers to 
make sure that what happened wouldn’t happen again. Stark gave instructions to Vision to keep Wanda inside the Avengers compound to protect her,  <img src = "images\Scar5.png" alt = "Scar5" style = "float: left">
which doesn`t sits well with her and it takes a good old fashion pep talk from Barton to get her out from her fear of hurting people and join 
the fight. The fight in question takes place in Germany where Cap`s team faces off against Tony`s and they don`t emerge victorious and Wanda is 
thrown into Raft prison, until Cap busts her and the rest of his team out.

 However two years later, the Black Order arrive and try to take the Mind Stone from Vision by killing him. Wanda and Vision try to fight them off, 
 but Vision is badly wounded and although Wanda puts a valiant fight she is no match for them and it takes the combined efforts of Cap, Black Widow and 
 Falcon to defeat them. After that the rouge team returns to the Avengers compound where they reunite with Rhodey and Bruce. Vision comes to the 
 conclusion that Wanda needs to destroy the Mind Stone in order to ensure that Thanos couldn`t get his hands on it, but Wanda refuses and so Cap 
 decides to take the team to Wakanda to get the Stone out of Visions forehead without killing him and then destroy it. But the armies of Thanos 
 arrive and Wanda is forced to get into the fight before the Stone can be removed. In the end when Thanos arrive to Earth she destroys the Stone 
 along with the one she loves, but alas Thanos uses the Time Stone to revrse what happened only to kill Vision again and get the Mind Stone and then 
 snaps Wanda and half of the Universe out of existence. 
<br>
<br>
Five years later however, Wanda is resurrected by the Hulk and she takes part in the fight against Thanos, where the Avengers emerge victorious, but 
Tony dies. At his funeral Wanda talks to Clint about the ones they lost and how they wish they could let them know that in the end things worked out.

Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his 
irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped 
of his power, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, 
finding love with Jane Foster, and helped <img src = "images\Thor2.png" alt = "Thor2" style = "float: right">
save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes 
and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.
<img src = "images\Thor4.png" alt = "Thor4" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
Upon being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor was forced to return to Earth in order to retrieve Loki after he had survived to fall 
through a black hole and had begun his attempt at world domination, having taken possession of the Tesseract. Thor joined the Avengers under 
<img src = "images\Thor5.jpg" alt = "Thor5" style = "float: right">
the guidance of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop the schemes of his own adopted brother, eventually following the newly formed team 
as they battled against Loki's army of the Chitauri during the Battle of New York until Loki was eventually defeated by the Avengers, 
captured and returned onto Asgard to await justice for his crimes against Earth.

Thor returned to Asgard having defeated his brother's schemes, as he then helped the Asgardian Armies restore peace across all of the Nine 
Realms during the War of the Nine Realms. However, the peace proved to be short-lived as Thor then fought the Dark Elves during the Second 
Dark Elf Conflict as they had attempted to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. During these events, Thor was reunited with Jane 
Foster who had become host to the Aether and a target of the Dark Elves, with Thor being forced to free Loki from imprisonment for his aid. 
Eventually, <img src = "images\Thor8.png" alt = "Thor8" style = "float: left">the Aether was removed from Foster's body and Loki seemingly sacrificed Thor from Kurse, leading to the Dark Elves and Malekith's 
defeat. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster.

<br>
<img src = "images\Thor9.png" alt = "Thor9" style = "float: right">
During his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers once again, this time in their attempts to locate Loki's Scepter. This also lead to him 
joining the fight against HYDRA. Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the team had to stop the newly 
created Ultron, a rogue invention inadvertently created by <img src = "images\Thor10.jpg" alt = "Thor10" style = "float: left">
Tony Stark which had threatened to wipe out all of humanity and replace it with 
its own Ultron Sentries. Once Ultron had been defeated, Thor promised his Avengers allies that he would return and went back to Asgard to 
investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by Scarlet Witch of the Infinity Stones. In his investigations, Thor also discovered 
that Loki was still alive and had usurped Odin's royal throne during Thor's absence.
<img src = "images\Thor11.png" alt = "Thor11" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
To aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought help from Doctor Strange. However, Thor was 
just too late to save his own father from death. Shortly afterwards, Thor met Hela, the Goddess of Death and his sister. In the wake of his 
first encounter with Hela, <img src = "images\Thor12.png" alt = "Thor12" style = "float: left">
Thor's hammer Mjølnir was destroyed and he was banished to Sakaar, where he was forced to compete in the Contest 
of Champions. After a reunion and subsequent fight with Hulk, the pair allied with the rogue Valkyrie in order to save Asgard and escape Sakaar. 
After battling with Hela and losing an eye to her, <img src = "images\Thor13.png" alt = "Thor13" style = "float: right">
Thor then had Loki unleash Ragnarök and destroy Asgard, killing Hela in the process, although 
he escaped with the remaining Asgardians. Declaring that Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound position as king 
and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth.

As they were en route to Earth, their ship was <img src = "images\Thor15.png" alt = "Thor15" style = "float: right">
attacked by Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Tesseract which Loki took from Asgard's vault 
at the last moment. Thor witnessed Thanos take the stone and murder his brother before he was flung from the ship and left for dead. He was picked 
up by the Guardians of the Galaxy and 
had teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot to travel to Nidavellir. With the help of Eitri, Thor crafted <img src = "images\Thor16.png" alt = "Thor16" style = "float: left"> 
Stormbreaker and aided the nation of Wakanda and the Avengers in defeating the Outriders and confronting Thanos. However, Thor squandered his chance 
to kill Thanos with his <img src = "images\Thor17.png" alt = "Thor17" style = "float: right">
new weapon and Thanos activated the completed Infinity Gauntlet and erased half the universe's population from existence 
before he escaped. After the Avengers were joined by Captain Marvel, the team traveled to the Garden, where Thor and the Avengers ambushed and 
interrogated Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor 
beheaded Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet.
<img src = "images\Thor18.png" alt = "Thor18" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
Following Thanos' death, Thor left the Avengers and relocated to Tønsberg, Norway, where he and the surviving Asgardians resettled, renaming the town 
New Asgard. Five years later, Hulk and Rocket traveled to New Asgard to convince the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin the team after 
discovering how to travel through time. <img src = "images\Thor19.png" alt = "Thor19" style = "float: right">
Thor joined the Avengers on their Time Heist and participated in the Battle of Earth, where he fought 
Thanos again alongside Captain America and Iron Man, the latter sacrificing his life to eliminate Thanos and his armies. After attending Stark's 
funeral, Thor decided to go with the Guardians of the Galaxy, proclaiming Valkyrie to succeed him as the new ruler of the Asgardians. </dd>

Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a <img src = "images\Hulk1.png" alt = "Hulk1" style = "float: right">
renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers. As someone who was highly respected for his work regarding 
biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation, he was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum which created Captain America, 
<img src = "images\Hulk2.jpg" alt = "Hulk2" style = "float: left">although Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. However, when an exposure to high levels of gamma radiation instead of vita radiation went 
awry, the mild-mannered scientist had found that when angered, provoked or excited, he would transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly mindless creature 
known as Hulk.
<img src = "images\Hulk3.png" alt = "Hulk3" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
Fearful of the damage that Hulk could inflict as well as fleeing from the United States government, Banner attempted to commit suicide; when the attempt failed, 
he chose to live a discreet life in South America while also communicating with Samuel Sterns to cure himself. However, when General Ross had sent a team led by 
<img src = "images\Hulk4.jpg" alt = "Hulk4" style = "float: left">
Emil Blonsky to apprehend Banner, he was then forced to return to New York City where he recruited the help of Betty Ross and Sterns to cure him of his affliction. 
Banner was apprehended by the Armed Forces shortly after, but Blonsky, who had received a variant of the Super Soldier Serum, was administered Banner's 
gamma-irradiated blood, transforming him into the Abomination and forcing Ross to allow Banner to turn into Hulk and battle him before then allowing Hulk to escape.
<img src = "images\Hulk5.jpg" alt = "Hulk5" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
Banner fled the United States and dedicated his 
time to aiding the sick and poor. When a mounting threat called for Banner's specialized scientific expertise, 
<img src = "images\Hulk6.png" alt = "Hulk6" style = "float: left">S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited him, knowing full well that the incredible strength of Banner's alter-ego, Hulk, would be an additional asset to the Avengers. Banner was 
tasked with tracking down the Tesseract, working alongside Tony Stark to achieve this. Despite almost causing a disaster when he was forcibly transformed into Hulk 
by Loki, Banner joined the Avengers during the Battle of New York and assisted them in defeating Loki and his Chitauri army. Once the Avengers split up in the wake 
of the battle, Banner had become good friends with Stark and relocated to the Avengers Tower, free to live his life without apprehension.
<img src = "images\Hulk7.png" alt = "Hulk7" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
In the wake of the HYDRA Uprising, the Avenger <img src = "images\Hulk8.png" alt = "Hulk8" style = "float: left">
regrouped once more to battle the ever-growing threat of HYDRA, successfully capturing Wolfgang von Strucker and 
retaking the Scepter. In order to make it so that Earth could always be safe without constantly needing the Avengers to protect it, Banner assisted Stark with 
creating Ultron, an artificial intelligence. Ultron, programmed to protect Earth at all costs, deemed humanity and the Avengers as its greatest threat and focused 
on annihilating them. Banner was then enlisted by Stark to help create Vision, and was later coaxed by Black Widow into transforming into Hulk and help defeat 
<img src = "images\Hulk9.jpg" alt = "Hulk9" style = "float: right">Ultron. Following Ultron's defeat, Hulk commandeered a Quinjet and left Earth, flying into space and coming across a wormhole that caused the Quinjet to crash on 
the planet Sakaar, where the stressful environment prevented him from regressing back into Banner, causing him to remain in Hulk form for two years.
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\Hulk10.png" alt = "Hulk10" style = "float: left">
On Sakaar, he became a gladiator for Grandmaster and was soon revered as a beloved champion, choosing to turn his back on Earth and enjoy the life of an admired 
warrior. However, when Thor arrived on the planet, Hulk fought against his old friend in the arena. In the wake of their fight, Thor informed Hulk that Asgard was 
under threat due to Hela's return. <img src = "images\Hulk11.png" alt = "Hulk11" style = "float: right">
Hulk aided the Asgardians in their fight, defeating Fenris and allowing the Asgardians to board the Statesman vessel, and as 
Ragnarök was unleashed, joined them on their voyage to Earth.
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\Hulk12.png" alt = "Hulk12" style = "float: left">
On their way back to Earth, the Statesman was attacked by the Black Order, who killed half of the Asgardians. Hulk challenged their leader, Thanos, who soundly 
defeated him. He was then teleported to the New York Sanctum by Heimdall, where Banner warned Doctor Strange, Iron Man and later Captain America of Thanos' arrival. 
Finding himself no longer able to transform into Hulk, Banner operated a Hulkbuster armor to aid the Avengers in the Battle of Wakanda. Although Banner and his 
allies managed to kill off Thanos' 
<img src = "images\Hulk13.png" alt = "Hulk13" style = "float: right">forces, Thanos personally arrived in Wakanda to retrieve the Mind Stone. He effortlessly subdued Banner and the other heroes 
and completed the Infinity Gauntlet, wiping out half of the universe's population, with Banner being one of the survivors.
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\Hulk14.png" alt = "Hulk14" style = "float: left">
Shortly after the Snap, Banner permanently merged himself and Hulk into one being, which combined Hulk's raw strength and physique with Banner's mind and intelligence 
and turned him into an adored celebrity. In 2023, he rejoined the Avengers to help them use Pym Particles and the Quantum Realm to travel through time. After traveling 
back to the Battle of New York in 2012, Banner successfully gained the Time Stone from the Ancient One and returned to the present. He and Rocket Raccoon helped Tony 
Stark design the Nano Gauntlet to contain the Stones the Avengers had collected, electing to use it to resurrect all the lives claimed by the Snap and injuring himself 
<img src = "images\Hulk15.png" alt = "Hulk15" style = "float: right">in the process. In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, which resulted in Iron Man's death, Banner sent Captain America to return the Infinity Stones to their proper 
places in time.

Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first superhero. Rogers had suffered from numerous 
health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from the service within United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers 
was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. Determined to serve, Rogers ultimately 
volunteered for the Project Rebirth, <img src = "images\Cap2.jpg" alt = "Cap2" style = "float: right">
which enhanced the frail Rogers' body to the peak of human physicality. Mistrusted by Chester Phillips, the head of the SSR, 
Rogers was relegated to propaganda campaigns, and was given the new moniker of Captain America. Rogers later joined the war with a combat role after he single-
handedly liberated captured Allied prisoners of war.
<img src = "images\Cap3.jpg" alt = "Cap3" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
From 1943 to 1945, Rogers attacked multiple HYDRA bases alongside the Howling Commandos, in another attempt to take down Red Skull, and recover the Tesseract. 
His famous World War II exploits had made him a living legend, and during this time he also formed a relationship with Peggy Carter. Despite Bucky Barnes 
<img src = "images\Cap4.png" alt = "Cap4" style = "float: right">seemingly died during a mission, Rogers carried on to help the Allies win the war, but crashed into the Arctic during his final mission. Rogers then spent 
sixty-six years encased into ice in suspended animation before Rogers was eventually found by S.H.I.E.L.D. in the early 21st century.
<br>
<br>
When he awoke, Rogers had found himself alone
in a modern world that he hardly recognized, with no idea what to do with his life. Following Loki having stolen 
<img src = "images\Cap5.jpg" alt = "Cap5" style = "float: left">the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and declaring war on humanity, Nick Fury enlisted Rogers' help in retrieving what he had once known as HYDRA's weapon, and also 
foiling Loki's plans. Joining the Avengers, Rogers played one of the key roles in the Battle of New York, successfully stopping the Chitauri Invasion, capturing 
Loki, and reacquiring the Tesseract while finding his place within this new world.
<img src = "images\Cap6.jpg" alt = "Cap6" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
Joining S.H.I.E.L.D. as his way to maintain peace and justice with the aid of Black Widow, Captain America had come into a fierce conflict against the Winter 
<img src = "images\Cap7.jpg" alt = "Cap7" style = "float: left">
Soldier who had seemingly assassinated Fury. Having been blamed for the incident by Alexander Pierce, Rogers discovered that HYDRA, whom he thought had dissolved 
in 1945, had existed in secret as a parasite within S.H.I.E.L.D., and that they were planning to use Project Insight as a way to bring about a new world order, 
while also learning that Winter Soldier was, in fact, his best friend Barnes, operating as the brainwashed assassin. Along Romanoff, Maria Hill and Falcon, Rogers 
had ended the HYDRA Uprising. As the immediate threat of HYDRA was quelled, Rogers embarked on a quest to locate Barnes.
<img src = "images\Cap8.png" alt = "Cap8" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\Cap9.jpg" alt = "Cap9" style = "float: left">
During the search for Barnes, the Avengers had assembled in order to eliminate the remnants of HYDRA, which prompted Rogers to abandon his own quest and rejoin 
all of his former teammates to help capture the Scepter and Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. After securing their victory, Rogers was almost immediately thrown into 
another crisis when Ultron, the new peacekeeping artificial intelligent program designed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, began a plot to eliminate humanity. 
<img src = "images\Cap10.png" alt = "Cap10" style = "float: right">
Following a prolonged and brutal conflict in which Vision's creation gave them an advantage, Ultron was defeated during the Battle of Sokovia: However, the cost of 
their battle meant many of the Avengers disbanded, while Rogers and Romanoff stayed to lead the second incarnation of the Avengers.
<img src = "images\Cap11.jpg" alt = "Cap11" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\Cap12.jpg" alt = "Cap12" style = "float: right">
While the Avengers conducted worldwide missions, they soon began tracking down Crossbones, only for Scarlet Witch to be blamed for innocent deaths when she failed 
to fully contain an explosion that Crossbones caused. Thaddeus Ross used the disaster to write the Sokovia Accords, but Rogers refused to sign due to moral 
disagreements. <img src = "images\Cap13.png" alt = "Cap13" style = "float: left">Rogers' problems increased more as Barnes resurfaced having seemingly caused a recent terrorist bombing, as Rogers chose to protect Barnes, which 
then lead to Ross sending Stark out to apprehend them both. Upon learning Helmut Zemo was to blame, Rogers fought against his former allies to find Zemo, only for 
Zemo's schemes to finally be completed as he revealed Barnes killed Stark's parents, resulting in Rogers going on the run and the Avengers falling apart due to 
Rogers and Stark's conflict.

<br>
<img src = "images\Cap15.jpg" alt = "Cap15" style = "float: left">
Having saved his friends from the Raft, Rogers sent Barnes to gain help from Black Panther in Wakanda, while he and all his allies then became vigilantes. However, 
when Thanos and his Black Order attacked Earth seeking the final Infinity Stones, Rogers came out of hiding in order to protect Vision. In order to keep Vision safe, 
Rogers had brought him to Wakanda, while he and Black Panther's army held off the onslaught of Outriders sent down by Thanos. Despite their success with destroying 
<img src = "images\Cap16.png" alt = "Cap16" style = "float: right">
Thanos' forces, when Thanos himself arrived on the planet, he effortlessly overpowered Rogers and all the other heroes and took the Mind Stone, killing Vision in 
the process. Despite all their attempts, Thanos completed his goal and wiped out half of the population of the universe, leaving Rogers to witness his best friend 
die again alongside his countless others.
<img src = "images\Cap17.jpg" alt = "Cap17" style = "float: left">
<br>
<br>
Five years after the Snap, Captain America and his fellow Avengers found a method to traverse through time safely and traveled to various points in the past to 
amass all six Infinity Stones. After successfully aiding in the resurrection of the lives taken by the snap, Captain America participated in the Battle of Earth 
<img src = "images\Cap18.png" alt = "Cap18" style = "float: right">
and was deemed worthy of Mjølnir, wielding it in combat against Thanos. After Iron Man sacrificed his life to kill Thanos and his army, Rogers attended his friend's 
funeral before traveling back in time to restore Mjølnir and the Infinity Stones to their original time. However, after returning the items, Rogers chose to travel 
back to the 1940s and live out a life in the past, where he married Peggy Carter. Having grown old, Rogers paid a visit to Wilson in 2023, entrusting him with his 
shield.

Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, was one of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of 
the Avengers. Originally a KGB operative and dangerous assassin, Romanoff was recruited into S.H.I.E.L.D. by Clint Barton. Having extensive mastery in martial 
arts and armed with her Widow's Bite, Black Widow became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents. During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark 
<img src = "images\BlackW2.png" alt = "BlackW2" style = "float: right">
Industries to watch Tony Stark due to the fear that he was dying. During this mission, Romanoff assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against 
him.
<br>
<br>
When Loki declared war on the Earth, Black Widow was recruited into the Avengers after Hawkeye had just been enthralled by Loki. Romanoff assisted in recruiting 
<img src = "images\BlackW3.jpg" alt = "BlackW3" style = "float: left">
Stark and Bruce Banner into the team while they tracked down and attempted to capture Loki, eventually saving Barton from his grasp. Once Loki's entire plan had 
been uncovered, Romanoff joined the team during the Battle of New York and was instrumental in destroying the portal over the city which had been created by the 
Tesseract, effectively ending the entire invasion while Loki was defeated and captured.
<img src = "images\BlackW4.png" alt = "BlackW4" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
In the wake of the Avengers successfully defeating Loki, Romanoff had continued her work with S.H.I.E.L.D., this time working with Captain America. While working 
together, Romanoff and Rogers uncovered a conspiracy following an assassination attempt on Nick Fury, which had eventually led to them discovering that HYDRA had 
somehow been infiltrating their entire organization. Despite the efforts of the Winter Soldier to stop them, Romanoff helped expose Alexander Pierce's evil schemes 
<img src = "images\BlackW5.jpg" alt = "BlackW5" style = "float: left">
to the world, which also resulted in all of her own morally dubious history being revealed. As a result, Romanoff was forced into dropping off the grid again and 
began rebuilding her cover.
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\BlackW6.png" alt = "BlackW6" style = "float: right">
Romanoff eventually rejoined the Avengers, working to bring down various HYDRA cells across the world and assisting in the capture of Wolfgang von Strucker. However, 
before she could form a romantic relationship with Banner, the rogue artificial intelligence Ultron was created by Stark and Banner, forcing Romanoff and the rest 
of their team to join together and defeat him. Despite being captured, Romanoff was able to inform the team of Ultron's location on Sokovia, resulting in a final 
<img src = "images\BlackW7.png" alt = "BlackW7" style = "float: left">
battle in which the Avengers had defeated Ultron once and for all. Unlike most members of the original Avengers, Black Widow remained a member while forming the 
second incarnation of the team.
<br>
<br>
<img src = "images\BlackW8.png" alt = "BlackW8" style = "float: right">
As many of the governments of the world had demanded the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords in the wake of their recent battles, Romanoff agreed to their terms 
and signed the Accords. She later joined Iron Man in a fight against Captain America due to his disagreements with the Accords and his criminal activities with 
<img src = "images\BlackW9.png" alt = "BlackW9" style = "float: left">
the Winter Soldier who Rogers was attempting to protect. As the two Avengers' factions fought against each other, Romanoff betrayed Iron Man's team in order to 
assist Captain America to find the instigator of the team's fight. As a result, Black Widow had to escape from the government for aiding Rogers, while being on the 
run, Romanoff soon joined him and Wilson in stopping terrorists.
<img src = "images\BlackW10.png" alt = "BlackW10" style = "float: right">
<br>
<br>
When the threat of Thanos approached Earth, Romanoff, Rogers, and Wilson protected Vision, who had the Mind Stone, which Thanos was after. They later defended 
<img src = "images\BlackW11.png" alt = "BlackW11" style = "float: left">
Wakanda from the attack, but were ultimately defeated when Thanos destroyed half of all life with the Infinity Gauntlet, where Romanoff emerged as one of the 
survivors. Romanoff was part of the Ambush on Thanos in an effort to retrieve the Infinity Stones and undo the Titan's snap, with no success.
<br>
<br>
Five years later, Romanoff led the Avengers alongside Captain America, now formed by Okoye, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula, War Machine, and Captain Marvel. In order to 
undo the Snap, the remaining Avengers split <img src = "images\BlackW12.jpg" alt = "BlackW12" style = "float: right">up in teams to retrieve all Infinity Stones from several alternate timelines in the Time Heist. Sent to retrieve the 
Soul Stone on Vormir with Barton, Romanoff, against Barton's insistence, willingly jumped off the Vormir mountains into the abyss below, sacrificing herself in 
the process in order to obtain the Soul Stone for the Avengers.
